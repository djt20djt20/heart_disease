This repo shows the code I used for the Medium Article entitled 'How to predict heart disease (using machine learning)'.

As a man in his mid-thirties, I was motivated to discover the degree to which age increases the risk of getting heart disease. To this end, I seek to answer three questions
1. How does the prevalence of heart disease vary with age?
2. Can I build a predictive model of heart disease using age as one of the variables?
3. From this model, how important a predictor is age of heart disease?

Libraries used:
pandas
matplotlib
seaborne
sklearn
